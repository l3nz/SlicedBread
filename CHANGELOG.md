Addes Log2 stats collector.

* 0.1.0.1 - April 27, 2014

Added a Gradle build script. This lets us push the repo to a public server (eg Bitbucket),
we can easily create Javadocs and run Findbugs on the project. Super!

* 0.1.0 - June 4, 2012

Sync'd a number of methods that have been developed on the
main project. Other projects are now using SB as a JAR library.

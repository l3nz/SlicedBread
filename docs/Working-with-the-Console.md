The MessagingConsole is a singleton object that is shared across all threads 
and acts as your access port to most of the features SlicedBread offers.

It lets you:

* Start multiple threads
* Create messaging ports to interact with those threads
* Send and receive messages 
* Run some utility functions

== Getting a Console instance

This is really easy; in any class that requires SlicedBread you add something like:

-----
final static MessagingConsole console = MessagingConsole.getConsole();
-----

The console will persist until the JVM closes.

== Registering an existing thread

To obtain a messaging PID (and associated mailbox) on the console, you "register"
your current thread as:

-----
PID myself = console.registerExistingThread("Main");
-----

This will create a new PID for the name "Main" and will open a mailbox.

To check if a mailbox exists or not, 

-----
PID areYouThere = console.findByDescription( "Printer/B" );
-----

The PID will be null if no mailbox esists under that name, or you will get a valid PID 
if it does exist. 

== Creating a new thread

In order to start new threads, you start them as:

-----
PID thread_A = console.register(myself, "Printer/B", new PrinterTask() );
-----

This will:

* Start a new thread called "Printer/B" and run PrinterTask on it (PrinterTask must implement the 
  TaskProcess interface, see below). The thread name is set so it is easy to tell what is what using
  a debugger / profiler / whatever
* A new mailbox is created under the name "Printer/B" and the thread receives it as its main mailbox
* The "myself" thread is set as the parent of the new thread; life-cycle events pertaining to this 
  thread (e.g it started, it crashed, it terminated) are sent here.

If you want to stop the thread, you send it a MsgPleaseStop message, like:

-----
console.send( MsgPleaseStop.build(myself, thread_A) );
-----

You will then receive a MsgProcessEneded when it stops. When a thread dies (because it stopped, or because 
it crashed, that is, threw an unhandled exception), the mailbox for the thread is removed, therefore any
thread can check whether another thread is running just by looking up its mailbox by name.  

=== Implementing a worker thread

Any worker thread must implement the TaskProcess interface, that has one single method called run().

----
@Override
public void run() {

    PID ownPid = getOwnPid();
    log (
        "I am thread "  + getProcessDescription()
        + " (created by " + getParentDescription() + ")"
    );
    MessagingConsole console = getConsole();

    try {
        for ( ;; ) {
            Msg m = console.receive(ownPid, 100);

            if ( m instanceof MsgPleaseStop ) {
                log( "Now Stopping" );
                return;
            } else
            if ( m instanceof MsgPrint ) {
                processMessage( (MsgPrint) m );
            };
        }
    } catch ( InterruptedException e ) {
        return;
    }

};
----

This is basically an endless loop that queries its mailbox for incoming messages, processes them
and  - if needed - sends results back. This object is given a mailbox and an instance of 
the console, plus a description and a PID of the parent.


=== Thread naming

Every mailbox has a name. All worker threads have a mailbox that shares their startup name. They are free 
to have more, e.g. multiple threads "Printer/01" and "Printer/02" might share a mailbox "Printer" where 
jobs are actually queued. 

== Sending and receiving messages

Messages are meant to be immutable, built of immutable parts (ideally, all 'final' fields). 
Defensive copying is your friend here. We usually create them all with a builder pattern, 
so they all look something like:

-----
MsgPleaseStop.build(from, to)
-----

All messges need to have a FROM and a TO mailbox that are not null. You create your own messages by 
extending the CustomMessage object.


In order to receive messages, you can either receive them one at a time or all at once.

-----
Msg m = console.receive( myPid, 200 );
-----

Will yeld a valid message or 'null'; if no message is available, it will wait no more than 200ms for 
one to become available.  

As an alternative, you can ask for all queued messages; like in:

-----
List<Msg> lM = console.receiveAll( myPid ); 
-----

== Thread safety considerations

The current version of the Console is backed by a ConcurrentHashMap, where

----
Read operations can thus proceed without locking, but rely
on selected uses of volatiles to ensure that completed
write operations performed by other threads are
noticed. 
-----

So the cross-thread visibility is basically free at the application level. 

This does not prevent you to keep stray pointers and modifying (supposedly) immutable 
object at run time when held by other threads. You have all the rope you need to hang 
yourself with, so respect the [[Golden Rules]] or you'll regret it.
